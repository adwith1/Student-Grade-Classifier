# Student-Grade-Predictor
This repository consists of a Machine Learning model that implements a linear regression algorithm which is used to predict a student's final grade based on select attributes.
The attributes used in this model include the student's study time, number of failures, number of absences, first grading period, and second grading period.
The data set can be found on UCI's machine learning repository under Student Record: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance.

To test this file, import the mat CSV file from UCI's database into Google Colab and then import my python script to run. The attributes can be changed to any integer based 
attribute for testing to observe what effects certain attributes have on a student's final grade. This repo will have multiple versions of student grade classifiers that
test the effects of different attributes. The predicted grade will be output along with the list of data and the expected output.
